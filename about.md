Hello!  You’ve reached the personal site of Christopher Ogden.  I’m a software developer with too many side [projects](http://ctogden.com/projects/). I originally chose to major in CS so that I could bring my ideas to fruition through code. I see myself as a generalist and lament the split of western intellectual endeavors into “the two cultures” of science and the humanities.

# Exploring Ideas

Here are some topics I’d like to explore (on this blog and elsewhere):

*   **Design** - responsive web design, architecture, the role of design in the modern world, and “What is design?”
*   **Alternative economies** - Gratipay, Patreon, Kickstarter, Etsy, the ransom funding model, and P2P/collaborative consumption
*   **Scientific computing and biotechnology** - I’m fascinated by the (now defunct) Nemaload project, despite understanding none of it
*   **Geoinformatics** - reading Charlie Loyd’s blog (and newsletter!) has me fascinated with the field of GIS and remote sensing
*   **Journalism** - investigative journalism, slow big picture “stories”, drone and sensor journalism, and citizen journalism
*   **Participatory government** - Brickstarter, civic hacking, and open data
*   **Publishing** - small presses, art books, content management systems, and collaborative writing systems (e.g. Editorially)
*   **Education/learning** - better textbooks (and other resources), education reform, MOOCs, apprenticeships, and DIY.org
*   **Electronics** - I got an Arduino one Christmas
*   **Reading** - I read a lot, but not enough; I’m trying to read more books and longform
*   **Farmsteading** - aquaponics, cash crops, organic farming, orchards, small animals, and beekeeping
