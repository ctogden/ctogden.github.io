Hello!  You’ve reached the personal site of Christopher Ogden.  I’m a software developer with too many side [projects](http://ctogden.com/projects/). I originally chose to major in CS so that I could bring my ideas to fruition through code. I see myself as a generalist and lament the split of western intellectual endeavors into “the two cultures” of science and the humanities[^1].

# Exploring Ideas

Here are some interests I’d like to explore (on this blog and elsewhere):

*   **Design** - responsive web design, architecture, the role of design in the modern world, and “What is design?”
*   **Alternative economies** - [P2P production](https://p2pfoundation.net/), collaborative consumption, alternative funding models
*   **Scientific computing and biotechnology** - I’m fascinated by the (now defunct) [Nemaload](https://web.archive.org/web/20150725025449/http://nemaload.davidad.org/) project, despite understanding none of it
*   **Geoinformatics** - reading Charlie Loyd’s blog (and [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/vruba)!) has me fascinated with the field of GIS and remote sensing
*   **Journalism** - investigative journalism, slow big picture “stories”, drone and sensor journalism, and citizen journalism
*   **Participatory government** - [Brickstarter](http://brickstarter.org/), [vTaiwan](https://civichall.org/civicist/vtaiwan-democracy-frontier/), civic hacking, and open data
*   **Publishing** - small presses, art books, content management systems, and collaborative writing systems (e.g. Editorially, RIP)
*   **Education/learning** - better textbooks (and other resources), education reform, new schools, apprenticeships, and [DIY.org](https://diy.org/)
*   **Reading** - few things are better than a good book
*   **Farmsteading** - hydroponics, aquaponics, cash crops, permaculture, orchards, small animals, and beekeeping
