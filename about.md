Hello!  You’ve reached the personal site of Christopher Ogden.  I’m a student in the Honors College at Stony Brook University and I’m about to finish an undergraduate degree in computer science.  I chose to major in CS so that I could bring ideas to fruition through code. I see myself as a generalist and lament the split of western intellectual endeavors into “the two cultures” of science and the humanities.

This site is a work in progress, but my goal is to write about a variety of topics. Rather than a constant chronological stream, I hope to organize a quality archive of categorized collections.  However, for the time being, you can see a list of [all posts](/archives).

Here are some topics I’d like to explore (on this blog and elsewhere):

*   **Design** - responsive web design, architecture, the role of design in the modern world, and “What is design?”
*   **Alternative economies** - Gittip, Kickstarter, Etsy, the ransom funding model, and P2P/collaborative consumption
*   **Scientific computing and biotechnology** - I’m fascinated by the Nemaload project, despite understanding none of it
*   **Geoinformatics** - reading Charlie Loyd’s blog has me fascinated with the field of GIS and remote sensing
*   **Journalism** - investigative journalism, slow big picture “stories”, sensor journalism, and citizen journalism
*   **Participatory government** - Brickstarter, civic hacking, and open data
*   **Publishing** - small presses, art books, content management systems, and collaborative writing systems (e.g. Editorially)
*   **Education/learning** - better textbooks (and other resources), education reform, MOOCs, apprenticeships, and DIY.org*   **Electronics** - I got an Arduino for Christmas
*   **Reading** - I read a lot, but not enough; I’m trying to read more books and longform
*   **Farmsteading** - aquaponics, cash crops, organic farming, orchards, small animals, and beekeeping
