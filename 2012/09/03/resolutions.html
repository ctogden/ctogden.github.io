<div class="post">
<p>Today I revisited my New Year’s Resolutions for 2012. I was going to review them publicly here, but I think I’d rather simply state that progress was made for most items and while my follow through wasn’t as good as hoped for, I am proud of what I have achieved. That said (and yes, I realize the year isn’t over yet), I’d like to set some new goals. These will hopefully be more precise, measurable, and actionable.</p>

<p>I’d like to accomplish these goals by this date next year.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lose 20 pounds</strong> - That’s about two pounds a month. This might be the most difficult goal, but few things are more important than health and fitness.</li>

<li><strong>Read 40 books</strong> - I read a lot, but most of it is shorter pieces on the internet. This isn’t healthy, sitting in front of a computer all day. And I miss real books, I really do.</li>

<li><strong>Write 60 blog posts</strong> - Someday I hope to receive a portion of my income from writing. Also, putting things in writing is a great way to improve ideas.</li>

<li><strong>Launch an app</strong> - I’m not sure of all the particulars yet, but I’d like to create some sort of small but meaningful application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things will appear to fill in the gaps.</p>
