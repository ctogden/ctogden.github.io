I missed another week (maybe I should call these bi-weekly dispatches from now on).  I blame the <span title="Hurricane Sandy">hurricane</span>.

So what's new?

* I finished the first half of Gene Wolfe's _The Book of the New Sun_ series, _Shadow & Claw_.  It's not bad, but it's very strange.  At one point, the protagonist and his allies ate the corpse of the his first love...  I'm also not sure how to classify it.  Is it science fiction or fantasy?  I guess both.
* I had some free time for once, and used it to write some letters to or call various friends and family.
* I weathered the hurricane with some friends.  Sleeping on a sofa half my size wasn't too comfortable, but being with friends was enjoyable.
* The 24 Hours of Good Hackathon hosted by Google was canceled.  That's unfortunate, but it gives me time to get caught up on this homework that's been piling up (despite delays of deadlines due to the storm).
