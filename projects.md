I like projects. I probably have a few too many of them going on. And I'll probably have a few more soon.

I need a better way to prioritize so it would be great if you'd let me know which ones you find especially appealing.

# Highlighted Projects

## Unhackathon

I have been an Unhackathon organizer from the beginning.

[Unhackathon](http://unhackathon.org/) is a series of events and related resources for developing as a programmer. We started with the goal of improving student hackathon culture by discouraging machismo, encouraging helping each other, and focusing on learning rather than competition. We were one of the first student-run hackathons to feature (and enforce) a strong code of conduct and to implement social guidelines (adapted from the Recurse Center's social rules). We made sure we served nourishing food at our events and provided rooms for napping. Mentorship from industry and academia has always been an important part of our events.

Now we are focusing on smaller shorter events because we believe that they are healthier, more sustainable, more accessible, and offer better learning opportunities than larger hackathons.
