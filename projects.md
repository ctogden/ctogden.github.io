Too many projects, too little time.

# Featured Projects

## Scout Upstate

[Scout Upstate](https://scoutupstate.com/) is a digital guide to Upstate New York, particularly the Catskills / Hudson Valley region. While still a work-in-progress, it currently includes an extensive guide to attractions in Upstate New York and a blog about news and events in the area. An improved design, more listings, additional guides, and a regional calendar are all in the works. 

The site is built with React/Next.js, and the web backend is currently a simple NodeJS service proxying the Airtable API.

# Past Projects

## Unhackathon

I was an organizer of Unhackathon since the organization's beginning.

[Unhackathon](http://unhackathon.org/) is a series of events and related resources for developing as a programmer. We started with the goal of improving student hackathon culture by discouraging machismo, encouraging helping each other, and focusing on learning rather than competition. We were one of the first student-run hackathons to feature (and enforce) a strong code of conduct and to implement social guidelines (adapted from the Recurse Center's social rules). We made sure we served nourishing food at our events and provided rooms for napping. Mentorship from industry and academia has always been an important part of our events.

# Future Projects?

Here's a sneak peek at one of the lists I've made outlining some other projects I am working on or thinking about. It's clearly overly ambitious, but that's okay.
