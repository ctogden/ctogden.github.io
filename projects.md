Here are some projects I’ve been involved with.  Some are finished or abandoned, others are works in progress or even still in the planning stage.  Many are collaborative efforts.

Hackathons
----------

I’ve attended half a dozen student hackathons in the past year or so.  They’ve been great learning experiences and sometimes one even walks away with a functioning application.  In order of attendance:

1. Google’s *24 Hours of Good*, Fall 2012 - This was my first hackathon. My team built a web scraping and data input tool that was inspired by the Pinterest bookmarklet intended for updating the Free Software Foundation’s software directory.  I was a bit out of my depth, but the experience sold me on the importance of hackathons as a learning opportunity.
2. *PennApps*, Fall 2013 - My team built a responsive web app for location based games. I spent most of the time mucking around in Bootstrap. We got the app working well enough to use it for the Stony Brook Computing Society’s annual Geek Games event, then realized we messed up the puzzles we were going to use it with...
3. *MHacks*, Fall 2013 - The internet went down campuswide for quite some time, one of our group members had to fly out and had a delayed flight, and the team member responsible for setting up our server (we should have just used App Engine) had a bunch of difficulties. Our hack (an events portal for Stony Brook) never got off the ground.
4. *HackMIT*, Fall 2013 - We built a Chrome extension for simple visual web scraping. It only operates based on HTML classes, but we’ve found uses for it sense, including our hack at McGill University
5. Google’s *24 Hours of Good*, Spring 2014 - We built a digital variant of the party game Mafia to educate players about web security. 
6.

    "*McHacks*, Spring 2014 - We built a silly Facebook app that’s actually pretty cool under the hood. [What’s my FB sin?](http://whats-my-fb-sin.com/) takes your latest statuses and feeds them to a machine learning model in the Google Prediction API and returns a result that tells you your worst Facebook habit. We’ve more rules, results, fixes, and other updates planned.

The Stony Brook Computing Society
---------------------------------

I discovered the SBCS at the end of my freshman year, back when it only had about 5 members. It quickly became the community of people with like interests that I had been seeking for.  I was elected Vice President my junior year and while I stepped down from an official e-board position for my senior year, I remain active in the club and its leadership. I helped grow club membership more than tenfold, and I’ve planned numerous educational, career-building, and outreach activities.  This semester we’re bigger than ever (the incredible [Hanne Paine](https://twitter.com/HannePaine) is owed the majority of the credit for this), holding weekly general body meetings and tech nights, frequent company tours, several hackathon trips, and more.  

Senior Thesis Project - Prolog Cloud
------------------------------------

My senior thesis for the Honors College at Stony Brook University is an web-based IDE for XSB Prolog. My advisor is Professor Paul Fodor of the CS department.

I’ll update this list soon with some more projects, including coursework, websites and apps I’m working on, and some non programming projects.
