title: Irksome RSS Sponsorships

Earlier today, I tweeted.

A number of my favorite blogs are now including advertisements amidst their other RSS items through services such as [The Syndicate](http://syndicateads.net/).  I generally don't have a problem with this.  If I'm not supporting their writing through a subscription I think it's fine for them to earn money from serving ads.  But when the last four or five items in my Google Reader are advertisements, I do get annoyed.  

Now, to be clear, I could easily unsubscribe.  And I might.  But I'd like to continue to follow these sites.  

Do I have a simple solution?  Unfortunately, no.  It would be nice if these RSS ad networks only posted advertisements on weeks when other posts appeared.  But I'm not sure if this is an option as advertisers are paying to be featured on these sites in advance, and the advertisements are often planned for a certain time for maximal effect.  And I am sure the bloggers don't want to miss out on their share of the profits either.

So, then, what should I do?  What should we do?
