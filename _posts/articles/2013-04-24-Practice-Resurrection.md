title: Practice Resurrection
---

I finally got around to watching Skyfall[^1] last weekend.  In one scene, Bond is asked about his hobbies.  "Resurrection" is his reply.[^2]  It reminded me of a catchphrase I devised in the past: "Practice resurrection".  It was catchy, but not knowing what it meant made it rather hard to use.  Now I've got a better idea.  It goes hand in hand with the goal of making mistakes. 

Fall.  Get up.  Fall.  Get back up again.  "Practice resurrection."

[^1]: A thrilling, and also deeply disturbing film.  I'm referring to the scene in which Bond slips, uninvited, into the shower of an abused woman deeply in need of help, not sexual partners.

[^2]: In the opening scenes Bond is shot and falls a great distance from the roof of a train into waterfalls below.  Everyone believes him dead.
