![Elisabeth scrapbooking]({{ site.url }}assets/images/Beth.jpg)

This is my sister Elisabeth.  That’s with an ‘s’.  She enjoys that her name is somewhat different (and also gets annoyed when it is misspelled as a result).  

A month or two ago, she was looking through an Ogden family genealogical album. In comparison to the names she found there, her name is quite mundane.

This is but a small sample:

* Uzal
* Elihu
* Amijah
* Eleazer
* Zurviah
* Euphrosine
* Isalin
* Zenas
* Agur
* Roscius
