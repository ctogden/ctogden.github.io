title: It has been awhile
---

Nearly two months since my last post.  Oops.  That shouldn't have happened...

Which isn't to say I haven't been busy.  It was a rough semester.  19 credits.  7 challenging classes. I made it through it though, and lucky me, I've now got over 6 weeks off (about 4 remaining).  

I'm enjoying the time off and the opportunity to read some books.  I got *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* for Christmas.  I'm a big fan of Robin Sloan's blogs and other schemes (I recommend [Snarkmarket](http://snarkmarket.com/) and his [Summer Reading series](http://www.robinsloan.com/summer-reading/)).  The story was good, but not great.  That's okay.  It's a first novel, and it still left me with plenty of interesting thoughts.

Soon I'll be finished with Frank Chimero's *The Shape of Design*.  I started it when I first got it, but it's been awhile so I started fresh.  I want to take it slowly, savor it, but instead I find myself rushing ahead.  And then I'll set it down to make sure I get the most I can out of it.  It's not heavy reading, but it's not light either, and that liminality is burdensome, especially when I had anticipated the book for so long.

I also started *Mockingjay*, the third book in The Hunger Games trilogy, yesterday.  More than halfway through it already.  It's good.  It's written for children/teenagers, and I think that's a good thing.  When dealing with the questions the book raises about the human condition, academic prose isn't going to do any better at resolving those enquiries.

I'll save other books for other days.  It's better that I read them first.

Instead I'll tell you about a project I've been working on a bit: on Quora I've started a board called [Things Everyone Should Know](http://www.quora.com/Things-Everyone-Should-Know).  As described there, it is "Inspired by Seth Godin's [The top 1,000 things to know](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/12/the_top_1000_th.html) post.  I'd like to eventually turn these into a daily email newsletter or something.  Some of these tell you what you should know, others go into more depth and explain how.  This is a work in progress."  The most exciting thing is that I'm often learning as I go along.  There's so little I know, so much to know.  Gotta keep on moving.
