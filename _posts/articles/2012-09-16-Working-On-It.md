title: Working on It
---

I'm half way through my degree, and despite my good grades I feel as if I've learned next to nothing.  I'm 20 (nearly 21) years old, and I'm not sure I know how to jumpstart a car or how to make sure I stay on the good side of the IRS.

Something has got to change.  Inspired by the [No Excuse List](http://www.noexcuselist.com/), which I was reminded of by J.D. Bentley's [Institutionalized](http://jdbentley.com/institutionalized/), and Joel Gascoigne's encouragement to ["Work harder on yourself than you do on your startup"](http://joel.is/post/22893893905/work-harder-on-yourself-than-you-do-on-your-startup), I've decided it's time for a "startup of the self".  I've also decided to track my progress openly, as much as I am comfortable with, perhaps a bit more.

What does this involve?  I'm not entirely sure yet.  My goals are not written in stone.  But today I have plenty of options.  Online learning platforms are popping up left and right, including [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Venture Lab](http://venture-lab.org/), [Marginal Revolution University](http://www.mruniversity.com/), [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/), and [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).  [Quora](http://www.quora.com/), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (and the wider [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/sites)) provide a great way to get answers to nearly any question.  [Lift](http://lift.do/) encourages follow through on daily goals to help establish habits (see my [profile](http://www.lift.do/users/1072867d6ae2ba25b107)).  [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com/) may be a great way to learn new languages, and [Memrise](http://memrise.com/) will help reinforce vocabulary through spaced repetition (it might also be worth looking into the courses from the [Foreign Service Institute](http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php).  Programming exercises are plentiful at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Interviewstreet](https://www.interviewstreet.com/).  Many books and other resources are published online, including [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), [The Shape of Design](http://shapeofdesignbook.com/), and [A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).  

I could go on, but it's time to start.
