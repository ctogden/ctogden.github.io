![A Page from Tim Denee's Calendar](http://ctogden.com/assets/images/deneetime.gif)

A few days ago, a link to a calendar available for free download appeared here at [Quipsologies](http://www.underconsideration.com/quipsologies/archives/january_2012/arminvit_53.php).  The preview was appealing so I followed the link to the calendar’s page at the designer Tim Denee’s site.  I’ve no need for a calendar for this year I decided (I’ve already got one spare), but I keep returning to the site to watch the slideshow preview of the images that appear on the calendar.  

The hand drawn illustrations show the passing of the seasons, while focusing on a log cabin that is set in the center of the page, unchanging despite the changes surrounding it.  I love this artwork, and watching it shift is somehow very alluring, almost magical.

Take a look yourself — [King Country](http://timdenee.com/Calendar), a calendar by Tim Denee.
