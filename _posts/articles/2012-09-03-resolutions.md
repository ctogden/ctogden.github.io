Today I revisited my New Year's Resolutions for 2012.  I was going to review them publicly here, but I think I'd rather simply state that progress was made for most items and while my follow through wasn't as good as hoped for, I am proud of what I have achieved.  That said (and yes, I realize the year isn't over yet), I'd like to set some new goals.  These will hopefully be more precise, measurable, and actionable.  

I'd like to accomplish these goals by this date next year.

* **Lose 20 pounds** - That's about two pounds a month.  This might be the most difficult goal, but few things are more important than health and fitness.
* **Read 40 books** - I read a lot, but most of it is shorter pieces on the internet.  This isn't healthy, sitting in front of a computer all day.  And I miss real books, I really do.  
* **Write 60 blog posts** - Someday I hope to receive a portion of my income from writing.  Also, putting things in writing is a great way to improve ideas.
* **Launch an app** - I'm not sure of all the particulars yet, but I'd like to create some sort of small but meaningful application.

Other things will appear to fill in the gaps.
