I resolve, for this year of 2012, to:

* Give more
* Spend more time considering my beliefs and goals

>Am I doing the right thing with my life? Do I believe the things I was taught as a child? What do the words I live by—words like duty, honor, and country—really mean? Am I happy? <br>—William Deresiewicz, in *Solitude and Leadership*

* Strengthen friendships

* Improve my study habits
  * Take detailed notes
  * Iterate
  * Evaluate after completion
  * Rework
  * Discuss with others
* Get out and about
  * Exercise
  * Enjoy nature
  * Work outdoors
