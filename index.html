  <p>Hello!  You've reached the personal site of Christopher Ogden.  I'm a student in the Honors College at Stony Brook University and I'm about to finish an undergraduate degree in computer science.  I chose to major in CS so that I could bring ideas to fruition through code. I see myself as a generalist and lament the split of western intellectual endeavors into "the two cultures" of science and the humanities.</p>
  <p>This site is a work in progress, but my goal is to write about a variety of topics. Rather than a constant chronological stream, I hope to organize a quality archive of categorized collections.  However, for the time being, you can see a list of <a href="/archives"all posts</a>.</p>
  <p>Here are some topics I'd like to explore (on this blog and elsewhere):</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Design - responsive web design, architecture, the role of design in the modern world, and "What is design?"</li>
  	<li>Alternative economies - Gittip, Kickstarter, Etsy, the ransom funding model, and P2P/collaborative consumption</li>
  	<li>Scientific computing and biotechnology - I'm fascinated by the Nemaload project, despite understanding none of it</li>
  	<li>Geoinformatics - reading Charlie Loyd's blog has me fascinated with the field of GIS and remote sensing</li>
  	<li>Journalism - investigative journalism, slow big picture "stories", sensor journalism, and citizen journalism</li>
  	<li>Participatory government - Brickstarter, civic hacking, and open data</li>
  	<li>Publishing - small presses, art books, content management systems, and collaborative writing systems (e.g. Editorially)</li>
  	<li>Education/learning - better textbooks (and other resources), education reform, MOOCs, apprenticeships, and DIY.org </li>
  	<li>Electronics - I got an Arduino for Christmas</li>
  	<li>Reading - I read a lot, but not enough; I'm trying to read more books and longform</li>
  	<li>Farmsteading - aquaponics, cash crops, organic farming, orchards, small animals, and beekeeping</li>
  </ul>
