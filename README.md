I ported my blog from Scriptogr.am to Jekyll here on GitHub pages but GitHub Pages does not play nicely with some of my posts.  Until I figure out how to fix this, you can still read posts here: http://scriptogr.am/ctogden.  Once I get that sorted out, I'll probably map my personal domain to ctogden.github.io.  Or not -- always thinking about the best way to do this.
