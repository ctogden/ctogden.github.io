            J.D. Bentley
          </h1>
          <p>Through Patrick Rhone’s post <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/2012/01/24/other-peoples-must-reads/">Other People’s Must Reads</a>, I discovered the site of J.D. Bentley.  Bentley is a designer, but his site is focused on his writing. The first post I read, <a href="http://jdbentley.com/the-californian-the-new-yorker/">The Californian &amp; The New Yorker</a>, tells of his attempt to get published in a traditional publication (the prestigious <em>The New Yorker</em>, no less). Tired of the mediocrity of publishing on the web, which he believes is mostly due to the ease of accessibility (almost anyone can get a blog up and running in a matter of minutes these days), he seeks vindication with his high goal. Unfortunately, they “aren’t need­ing any new writ­ers right now”. He says he is relieved, and concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m greatly dis­ap­pointed that the web allows medi­oc­rity to be so eas­ily dis­trib­uted, but I should not over­look the fact that it also offers this cheap, world­wide dis­tri­b­u­tion to the thought­ful and the tal­ented. If you work hard to learn a craft and even harder to mas­ter it, if you put great thought into what you say and who you want to say it to, then there’s no bet­ter place to be pub­lished than on a web­site you your­self own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He encourages us to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get an audi­ence, or get bet­ter and then get an audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, one of my goal with this site is to get an audience, but my focus is to improve my writing and thinking. Another Bentley post, <a href="http://jdbentley.com/our-secret-handshake-is-not-an-algorithm/">Our Secret Handshake Is Not An Algorithm</a>, explains his decision to not include a comment form on his posts, as well as his decision to block search engines. I haven’t gone so far as the second, but the lack of comments on this site is deliberate (with that said, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:ctogden@gmail.com">ctogden@gmail.com</a> if you have something to discuss).</p>

<p>In recounting the article, though, I’m getting away from my point: that you should be reading it yourselves, and his other posts as well. I’ll be working my way through his past postings whenever I have the chance. Join me in the <a href="http://jdbentley.com/archive/">archives</a>!</p>

<p>P.S. Speaking of Patrick Rhone, don’t forget <em><a href="http://www.enoughbook.com/">Enough</a></em>, his new book published digitally.</p>
